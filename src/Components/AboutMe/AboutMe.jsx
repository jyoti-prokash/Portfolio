                Hello! I'm Jyoti Prokash, a passionate web developer based in
                Dhaka, Bangladesh. My journey into programming began with a
                desire to develop valuable skills, which quickly turned into a
                passion for creating engaging digital experiences.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                I enjoy working on a variety of projects, focusing on clean,
                efficient code and user-friendly design. Outside of programming,
                I have a keen interest in drawing and playing sports, which help
                fuel my creativity and provide balance.
